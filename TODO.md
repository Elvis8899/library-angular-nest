## Frontend UI with Angular Material (2026-10-20)

The theme, login, forms, dialogs and lists are rebuilt with Angular Material (branch `frontend-material-ui`), and work at phone width. Two API problems found on the way:

- [ ] **API: search and role filter on `GET /v1/users`**. The choose-user dialog loads the largest page (1000 users) and searches it in the browser, so with more clients than that some can't be picked.
- [ ] **API: deleting a book erases its rentals**. `DELETE /v1/bookInfos/:id` has no checks, and the schema cascades from the book to its copies and from each copy to its rentals (`onDelete: Cascade`), so deleting a book with rented copies silently erases active rentals; removing a copy (`DELETE /v1/bookInfos/item/:id`, available copies only) erases that copy's past rentals. The book list has no delete button until the API refuses books with rented copies and keeps rental history (for example `onDelete: Restrict` or soft deletes).
